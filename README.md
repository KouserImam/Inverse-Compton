# Inverse-Compton
This Jupyter Notebook illustrates the Inverse compton scattering which is responsible for the production of hard x rays in the AGN. 
Shown in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KouserImam/Inverse-Compton/blob/main/Inverse_compton.ipynb)

There are two types of Compton scattering. Those are as follows.

Synchrotron Self Compton(SSC) which is shown in the first plot considering as AGN and Blazars target for the inverse Compton the synchrotron photons produced in the blob by the accelerated electrons.The synchrotron self Compton radiation calculation works exactly as the Synchrotron Radiation one. The physics behind this has been explained in the paper[DermerMenon2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...692...32D/abstract).

External Compton(EC) which is done by considering AGN as a target for the inverse Compton the (direct and reprocessed) photon fields generated by the accretion phenomena disscussed in [Finke2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...830...94F/abstract)
